Version 0.9.8 contains the following major new features w.r.t. 0.9.4
 - a chunksize parameter can be used to control the granularity of the
   parallelism: each worker will handle a series of chunks of this size
   and ask for them when ready, thus allowing the system to achieve
   automatic load balancing
 - very specialised versions of the map function are now available for
   arrays and float arrays, allowing to obtain significant speed-up even
   on relatively light computations
 - autoconf and ocamlbuild harness should simplify compilation and installation
