This code started as a two day exercise in July 2011,
by Marco Danelutto and Roberto Di Cosmo, that produced
the architecture now contained in simplemapper.

It has evolved significantly after, and is now
contains a particularly efficient version of the
map code on float arrays, incorporating ideas from
Paul Vernaza, and that works thanks to smart code
and significant insight from Jerome Vouillon.

Pietro Abate provided autoconf and ocamlbuild support.
